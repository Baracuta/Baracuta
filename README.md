- 👋 Hi, my name is Benjamin (although just "Ben" works just fine)!
- 👀 I’m interested in software development as a career, and I have a passion for playing Dungeons and Dragons.
- 🌱 I previously attended the Memorial University of Newfoundland at the Grenfell Campus in Corner Brook, Newfoundland.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment, seeing as I'm still learning.
- ✨ I'm currently a student of GetCoding
